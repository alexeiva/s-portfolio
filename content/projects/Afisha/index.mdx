Custom Lettering for Afisha Magazine
Year: 2012

The design brief was to create a custom display typographic lettering for Russia's prominent entertainment and lifestyle magazine Afisha. The magazine was published between 1999 and 2015 reaching 1.5 million people, and 4.5 million online users monthly. 

The lettering had to be visually different from the magazine typeface Afisha Serif, be bold yet elegant, but also lacking mannerism.
