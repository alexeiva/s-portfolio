ollimo is a supplier of natural raw materials for food ingredients based in Moscow, Russia. 
The brief was open regarding design with a request to reflect the companies core values of respect, reliability, and commitment to nature.

A soft-spoken yet confident Tone of Voice was chosen. The graphic idea combines organics and geometrics. The core shape is rotated to form a broad palette of supplies.
