My interest in letterforms sparkled since 2001 when I began studying Graphic Design. 
I eagerly attended type lectures and developed my first modular typeface.
Type Design stands at the intersection of Craft and Science, which drew my attention.
My interest in foreign languages lines up well with type design: drawing letters knowing how they sound brings more awareness to the process.

I consulted on many Cyrillic type projects ranging from Amazon Kindle to facebook (for Dalton Maag). 
My input on Cyrillic was beneficial for foundries like Huerta Tipográfica, TypeMates, ArrowType, facetype, Catharsis Fonts, &DISCOVER. Google Fonts

I collaborated on Cyrillic Extenions with facetype (Strangelove), Newlyn (New Rubrik), PhilaType (Merge)
