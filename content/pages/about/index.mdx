# Alexei Vanyashin

My interest in letterforms sparkled in 2001 when I began studying Graphic Design. I eagerly attended type lectures and developed my first modular typefaces.
Learning foreign scripts and languages is another interest fired up by my overall typographic curiosity. I want to know how letters sound to draw them properly.
